# Module 2

Module 2 consists of the stage of constructing the prediction functions between feature vectors and observed values by using artificial neural networks, R-MLR, and random forest (Section 4.1).
  
- Constructing Prediction Functions

  Construct prediction functions using the descriptor files generated in [Module 1](/chi-parameter/Module_1).
