# Instances for the Paper

This folder contains the data sets and instance files used for this paper.

- chi-aoki.zip / chi-nistane.zip / chi-jocta.zip

  The sdf files and learning results (Tables 2-4) for the data sets **Chi-Aoki**, **Chi-Nistane**, and **Chi-JOCTA**, respectively.
  A code for using J-OCTA to compute the solubility parameters is also included.

  The data set **Chi-Aoki** is from [Aoki et al., *Macromolecules* (2023) 56, 5446–5456](https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.macromol.2c02600), and the preprocessing scripts are included in [chi-aoki.zip](./chi-aoki.zip).

  The data set **Chi-Nistane** is from [Nistane et al., *MRS Communications* (2022) 12, 1096–1102](https://doi.org/10.1557/s43579-022-00237-x), and the preprocessing scripts are included in [chi-nistane.zip](./chi-nistane.zip).

  The data set **Chi-JOCTA** is generated by J-OCTA, and is generously provided by JSOL Coopeation.

- milp-aoki-nistane.zip / milp-jocta.zip (.z01, .z02)

  The instance files and detailed results (Tables 5-6) for the experiments of Sections 4.2 and 4.3, respectively.

  Please place the three files — `milp-jocta.zip`, `milp-jocta.z01`, and `milp-jocta.z02` — in the same directory before unzipping them.
