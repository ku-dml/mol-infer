scikit_chemgraph_learning.py

This file implements functions that given a file with
descriptor values of chemical compounds and a file with target values,
performs 5-fold learning using an artificial neural network (MLP regressor)
and stores the weights and biases of the training iteration that achieved
the highest R^2 test score over the 5 trials. 

Command line arguments include
 - filename with a list of descriptors
 - filename with a list of target values
 - filename for the output weights and biases
 - network architecture, as a list of hidden layer sizes
 
The program will output on the terminal the R^2 and MAE scores, and
time taken for training for each 
trial in the 5-fold cross-validation, 
and the averages over the 5 trials at the end.
