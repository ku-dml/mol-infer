## Conctructing Prediction Functions

The folder contains the codes used to construct the prediction functions between the given desctiptor file of the whole data set ('SINGLE_xxx') or the two subsets ('SEP_xxx').

In both cases, we conduct the experiment in two stages, namely:
- the preliminary experiment ('xxx_pre') to specify the hyperparameters, and
- the evaluation experiment ('xxx_eval') to evaluate the learning performance by 10 times 5-crossvalidation, and construct the prediction function files that will be used later in the stage of solving inverse problem ([Module 3](HPS/Module_3)).

Usage:

For learning using the whole data set ('SINGLE_xxx'):

Preliminary experiment:

```
python
```

Here:
- OUTPUT_desc_norm.csv/OUTPUT_hK_desc_norm.csv: the linear/quadratic descriptor files generated in [Module 1](/HPS/Module_1) of the whole given data set;
- INPUT_values.txt: the file containing observed value information of the data set, and
- -learning_method:

The output will be

Evaluation experiment:

```
python
```

Here:

The output will be

For learning using the two subsets generated by [Splitting Data Sets via Hyperplanes](HPS/Module_2/Splitting_Data_Sets_via_Hyperplane):

Preliminary experiment:

```
python
```

Here:
- C1_desc_norm.csv: the linear/quadratic descriptor files of the subset 'C1';
- C1_values.txt: the file containing observed value information of the subset 'C1';
- C2_desc_norm.csv: the linear/quadratic descriptor files of the subset 'C2';
- C2_values.txt: the file containing observed value information of the subset 'C2';
- -learning_method_for_C1:
- -learning_method_for_C2:

The output will be

Evaluation experiment:

```
python
```

Here:

The output will be
