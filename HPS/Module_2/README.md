# Module 2

Module 2 consists of the stage of constructing the prediction functions between feature vectors and observed values by using several machine learing methods (Section 4) and the newly-proposed method of splitting a given data set with a hyperplane in the feature space into two subsets (Section 5).

- Spltting Data Sets via Hyperplanes
- Prediction Functions
