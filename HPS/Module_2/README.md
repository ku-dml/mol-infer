# Module 2

Module 2 consists of the stage of constructing the prediction functions between feature vectors and observed values by using several machine learing methods (Section 4) and the newly-proposed method of splitting a given data set with a hyperplane in the feature space into two subsets (Section 5).

- Spltting Data Sets via Hyperplanes

  Use a linear program formulation to find a hyperplane to split the given data set into two subsets as described in Section 5.
  
- Constructing Prediction Functions

  Use machine learning methods to construct prediction functions using the linear/quadratic descriptor files generated in [Module 1](HPS/Module_1) in the cases of LLR, ANN, ALR, RLR, or the two splitted subsets generated above in the case of HPS.
