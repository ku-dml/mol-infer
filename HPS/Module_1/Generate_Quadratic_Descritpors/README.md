## Generate Quadratic Descriptors

This folder contains the code to generate the quadratic descriptors defined in Section 3, paragraph "Feature Function".
A file containing the information of linear desctiors and a file containing the observed value information is necessary.

Usage:

```
python generate_quadratic_descriptors.py OUTPUT_desc_norm.csv INPUT_values.txt K
```

Here 'OUTPUT_desc_norm.csv' is the file of linear descriptors generated by [Generate Linear Desciptors](), 'INPUT_values.txt' is the file containing observed value information of the dataset, and 'K' is the number of selected descriptors. (Please refer the paper for more information about the procedure of reducing descriptors.)
When the generator finishes normally, it will generate the following files:
- OUTPUT_hK_desc_norm.csv
  The csv file of the quadratic descriptors of the dataset with resulting descriptor number K.

A sample usage:

```
python generate_quadratic_descriptors.py ./sample_instance/At_large_var0_desc_norm.csv ./sample_instance/At_large_norm_values.txt 5000
```
