## Generate Quadratic Descriptors

This folder contains the code to generate the quadratic descriptors defined in Section 3, paragraph "Feature Function".

A file containing the information of linear desctiors and a file containing the observed value information is necessary. See [[28]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.13527) for more details.

Usage:

```
python generate_quadratic_descriptors.py DATASET_desc_norm.csv DATASET_values.txt K
```

Here:
- DATASET_desc_norm.csv: the linear descriptor file generated by [Generate Linear Desciptors](HPS/Module_1/Generate_Linear_Descriptors);
- DATASET_values.txt: the file containing observed value information of the data set, and
- K: the required number of reduced descriptors. (Please refer the paper for more information about the procedure of reducing descriptors.)
  
When the generator finishes normally, it will generate the following file:
- OUTPUT_hK_desc_norm.csv: the csv file of the quadratic descriptors of the data set with resulting descriptor size K.

A sample usage:

```
python generate_quadratic_descriptors.py ./sample_instance/At_large_var0_desc_norm.csv ./sample_instance/At_large_norm_values.txt 5000
```
