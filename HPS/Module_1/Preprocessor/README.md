# Preprocessor
- **eliminate.py** builds an _SDF_ file that is the subset of feasible molecules in a given SDF file.
- **limit_atoms.py** builds an _SDF_ file that is the subset of molecules containing only specified atoms in a given SDF file. 
- Note that [SDF files that are used in the paper](../../instances_for_paper) are already processed by these two scripts. You don't need to run the scripts for the SDF files in the above directory.
