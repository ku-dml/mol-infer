# Module 1

Module 1 consists of the stage of generating the feature vectors (defined in Section 3, paragraph "Feature Function") of a given data set (sdf format file).

- Generate Linear Descriptors:
  
  Generate the _linear descriptors_ file of a given data set.
  
- Generate Quadratic Desctiptors:
  
  Generate the _quadratic descriptors_ file of a given data set that is used in the learning method RLR.

- Preprocessors:

  Build an _SDF_ file that is the subset of feasible molecules in a given SDF file. Note that [SDF files that are used in the paper](../instances_for_paper) are already processed by the preprocessing scripts; you don't need to run the scripts for them.
