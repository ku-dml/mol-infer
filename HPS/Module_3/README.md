# Module 3

Module 3 consists of the stage of solving an MILP formulation for the inverse problem to infer a chemical graph described in Section 6.2, paragraph "Solving an MILP for the Inverse Problem" and "Generating Neighbor Solutions".

- Solving an MILP for the Inverse Problem
  When given a prediction function obtained from [Module 2](HPS/Module_2), a set of rules called *topological configuration* $\sigma$ that describes an abstract structure for a chemical graph, and two real numbers $\underline{y}^* $ and $\overline{y}^* $, infer **ONE** chemical graph $\mathbb{C}^* $ such that the predicted property value of $\mathbb{C}^* $ will be inside the range $\[ \underline{y}^*, \overline{y}^*  \]$.
