# Module 2
Module 2 consists of the stage of constructing prediction functions by using several machine learning methods and newly introduced prediction strategies (Section 3.1.5) using linear descriptors files generated in Module 1.
- **MLR:** Constructing prediction function by MLR without any descriptor selection. 
- **LLR-ANN:** Constructing prediction function by ANN on best selected descriptors by LLR.
- **LLR-LLR:** Constructing prediction function by LLR on best selected descriptors by LLR.
- **FSP-MLR:** Constructing prediction function by MLR on best selected descriptors by FSP.
- **MLR-LOO:** Constructing prediction function by MLR without any descriptor selection by using LOO strategy.
- **LLR-ANN-LOO:** Constructing prediction function by ANN with descriptors selected by LLR using LOO.
- **FSP-MLR-LOO:** Constructing prediction function by MLR-LOO with descriptors selected by FSp using 5-fold cross-validation.
- **FSP-LOO-MLR:** Constructing prediction function by MLR-LOO with descriptors selected by FSP using LOO.
