# Module 2

Module 2 consists of the stage of constructing the prediction functions between feature vectors and observed values by using Lasso linear regression (Section 4, Stage 3).
  
- Constructing Prediction Functions

  Use Lasso linear regression to construct prediction functions using the descriptor files generated in [Module 1](Polymer/Module_1).
