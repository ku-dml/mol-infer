# Module 3

Module 3 consists of the stage of solving an MILP formulation for the inverse problem to infer a chemical graph described in Section 4, Stage 4, paragraphs "Stage 4" and "Inferring a Polymer with Target Values in Multiple Properties", respectively.

- Solving an MILP for the Inverse Problem
  
  When given a prediction function obtained from [Module 2](Polymer/Module_2), a set of rules called *topological configuration* $\sigma$ that describes an abstract structure for a chemical graph, and two real numbers $y_l$ and $y_u$, infer **ONE** chemical graph $C$ such that the predicted property value of $C$ is inside the range $\[y_l, y_u  \]$.

- Inferring a Polymer with Target Values in Multiple Properties

  Mostly the same as the above one, but infer **ONE** polymer with target values for **MULTIPLE** properties at the same time.
