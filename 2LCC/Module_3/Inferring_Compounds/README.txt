This module corresponds to the 4th stage in the paper.

For conducting the experiment in the paper,
Please add the file path according to the comments in lines 6-21 of the 'infer_output_graph_LR.py' file,
and uncomment corresponding lines (352-355).
The document provides an example of using the instance "IhcLiq_3_a0" that construct by IhcLiq dataset.

For the convenience of getting started quickly,
I marked the corresponding variable names in the code after the files in the IhcLiq folder,
for example, "instances_for_paper -> stage_4 -> instance -> IhcLiq_3_a0(seed_tree_path)" means
that "IhcLiq_3_a0(seed_tree_path)" is the file required for the "seed_tree_path" variable in the code.
Do not forget to modify the target value (352-355).

The "instances_for_paper -> stage_4 -> result" directory provides all experimental results that appear in the paper for reference.
