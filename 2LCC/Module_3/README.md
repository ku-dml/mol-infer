# Module 3

Module 3 consists of the stage of solving an MILP formulation to infer a chemical graph described in Section 5.3 "Inference Experiments (Stage 4)".

- Inference Experiments
  
  When given a prediction function obtained from [Module 2](2LCC/Module_2), a set of rules called *specification* $\sigma$ that describes an abstract structure for a chemical graph, and two real numbers $y_l$ and $y_u$, infer **ONE** chemical graph $C$ such that the predicted property value of $C$ is inside the range $\[y_l, y_u  \]$.
