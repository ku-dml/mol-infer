Module 2 consists of the stage of constructing the prediction functions between feature vectors and observed values by using Lasso linear regression (Section 5.2).
  
- Constructing Prediction Functions

  Use Lasso linear regression to construct prediction functions using the descriptor files generated in [Module 1](/2LCC/Module_1).
